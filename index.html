          <h3>Kalyani K</h3>
          <p>How soon and how well you can achieve your testing goals depends solely on the capabilities of the testing team. Within the testing team itself it is important to have the correct blend of testers who can efficiently work together to achieve the common testing goals. While forming a team for testing, it is important to ensure that the members of the team jointly have a combination of all the relevant domain knowledge that is required to test the software under development.</p>

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>It is very important to ensure that the software testing team has a proper structure. The hierarchy and roles should be clearly defined and responsibilities too should be well defined and properly distributed amongst the team members. When the team is well organized the work can be handled well. If every team member knows what duties he or she has to perform then they will be able to finish their duties as required well within the time limit. It is important to keep track of the testers’ performance. It is very important to check what kind of defects the tester is able to uncover and what kind of detects he tends to miss. This will give you a fair idea about how serious your team is about the work.</p>
